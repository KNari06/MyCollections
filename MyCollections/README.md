# MyCollections

Custom implementations of core data structures in Java.

## Implemented Structures

- `MyArrayList` – dynamic array
- `MyLinkedList` – doubly linked list
- `MyStack` – LIFO structure (based on MyArrayList)
- `MyQueue` – FIFO structure (based on MyLinkedList)
- `MyMinHeap` – binary min-heap (based on MyArrayList)

## Features

- No usage of `java.util.*` except `Iterator`
- Generic types supported
- Manually managed memory (dynamic resizing, node links)

## How to Run

1. Open in IntelliJ IDEA
2. Run `Main.java` to test all structures
